What is this?
-------------
This is an IRC bot written in PHP, allowing users to play the popular Werewolf game. This implementation of wolf is very similar to [wolfbot-new](http://code.google.com/p/wolfbot-new/), and takes upon many of the same features.

What is Werewolf?
-----------------
Werewolf is a variant of the party game [Mafia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%28party_game%29). In summary, the objective is the reduce the numbers of the opposing team. At the start of the game, players are privately assigned roles as a wolf, or villager (unknown to others). At night, the wolves select one victim to kill, and when the sun rises, villagers must persecute (lynch) one person they beleive is the wolf with a majority vote. This is a game of trust, and deceptiveness, as no one can be certain of who everyone else is. The game continues until there are the same amount of wolves as villagers (wolves win), or all the wolves are dead (villagers win).

Why phpwolf?
------------
phpwolf is a rewritten wolfbot designed to benefit from the features offered by the PHP language. The project is just a couple days old as of July 5th, and there are future goals beyond IRC in the making. Have fun!
