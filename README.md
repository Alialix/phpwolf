phpwolf
=======

What is this?
-------------
phpwolf is an IRC bot written in PHP, allowing users to play the popular Werewolf game. This implementation of wolf is very similar to [wolfbot-new](http://code.google.com/p/wolfbot-new/), and takes upon many of the same features.

What is Werewolf?
-----------------
Werewolf is a variant of the party game [Mafia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%28party_game%29). In summary, the objective is to eliminate members of the opposing team. At the start of the game, players are privately assigned roles as a wolf, or villager (all unknown to others). At night, the wolves select one victim to kill, and when the sun rises, villagers must persecute (lynch) one person they beleive is the wolf with a majority vote. This is a game of trust, and deception, as no one can be certain of the roles of everyone else. The game continues until there are the same amount of wolves as villagers (wolves win), or all the wolves are dead (villagers win).

Why phpwolf?
------------
phpwolf is a rewritten wolfbot designed to benefit from the features offered by the PHP language. The project is going extremely well, and there are future goals beyond IRC are in the making. git, clone, and have fun!

As of Saturday, November 11th 2012, the only requirement left to completion is IDLE check. The web implementation is still under consideration with a HTML5 IRC WebSockets client or AJAX as options.
